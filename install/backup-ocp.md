### How to backup your Openshift Container Platform:

In order to successfully run the following script you need to run it from a virtual machine INSIDE the VPC network of the OCP cluster and that contains the SSH private key that pairs the SSH public key which was injected in the virtual machines of the cluster during the installation process.
```bash
for master in $( oc get node | awk /master/'{ print $1 }' )
do
  ssh core@$master 'mkdir backup; sudo -E /usr/local/bin/cluster-backup.sh backup'
done


```
