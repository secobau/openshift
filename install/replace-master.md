## How to replace a master Machine by a new master MachineSet

1. Create a new master MachineSet based on this template:
   * https://github.com/secobau/openshift/blob/master/install/machineSet.yaml
   
   Be careful to place the MachineSet in the correct availability zone.
   There should normally be only one master Machine per availability zone.
1. Delete the master Machine you want to replace.
1. Monitor the pods for all projects until the cluster is stable.
Only etcd-quorum-guard Pod should remain in a pending state. 
It is also normal that etcd ClusterOperator is in a degraded state with one member down.
1. Connect to any openshift-etcd Pod and run the following commands to identify the deleted master Node and remove it from the list:
   
   ```
   etcdctl member list
   etcdctl member remove <ID>   
   ```
1. Edit the Machine Count for the new master MachineSet from 0 to 1.
1. Monitor the pods for all projects until the cluster is stable.
1. Repeat the process with the next master Machine you want to substitute.
